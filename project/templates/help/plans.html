<h1>plans</h1>
<p class="lead">drp is free to use anonymously. A free account gives you longer-lived drops and cross-device sync. Paid plans add storage, larger uploads, locked drops, and explicit expiry you control.</p>

<h2>expiry in plain english</h2>
<p><strong>Anonymous clipboard drops</strong> expire 24 hours after the last view, or after 7 days total — whichever comes first. No way to extend them.</p>
<p><strong>Free account clipboard drops</strong> expire 48 hours after the last view, or after 30 days total. Still automatic — you cannot set a specific date.</p>
<p><strong>Paid drops</strong> let you choose an explicit expiry date at upload time: up to 1 year for Starter, up to 3 years for Pro. They can also be renewed, pushing the expiry forward by the same duration again.</p>
<p><strong>File drops</strong> (anon and free) expire 90 days after upload regardless of access.</p>

<h2>what "locked" means</h2>
<p>On anonymous and free plans, after the 24-hour post-creation window anyone who knows your key can overwrite its content. This is by design for quick ephemeral sharing.</p>
<p>Paid drops are permanently locked to your account the moment you create them. Only you can edit, rename, delete, or renew them. No one can overwrite a key you own.</p>

<h2>storage quota</h2>
<p>Storage counts file drops only — text clipboards are free. Your current usage is shown on your <a href="/auth/account/">account page</a>. If a file upload would push you over quota it is rejected immediately at upload time with a clear error. Deleting a file drop frees the storage instantly.</p>

<h2>password protection</h2>
<p>Paid accounts can add a password to any drop they own. The password is stored as a secure hash (PBKDF2) — it is never saved in plain text. Browsers remember unlocked drops for the session. The CLI prompts for passwords automatically when needed.</p>

<h2>free accounts</h2>
<p>Signing up needs only an email and password — no credit card. You get longer expiry, bookmarked drops, export/import, and cross-device sync (drops are attached to your account, not just your browser cookie).</p>

<h2>upgrading &amp; billing</h2>
<p>Paid plans bill monthly through <a href="https://www.lemonsqueezy.com" rel="noopener">Lemon Squeezy</a>. Upgrade from your <a href="/auth/account/">account page</a>. Cancelling returns you to the free plan at the end of the billing period — your drops are not immediately deleted, but paid-only limits no longer apply to new uploads. Manage or cancel any time in the <a href="/billing/portal/">billing portal</a>.</p>
