<h2>what "locked" means</h2>
<p>Anonymous and free drops are unlocked — after the 24h creation window, anyone who knows the key can replace the content. This is intentional for quick sharing, but means your drop isn't private.</p>
<p>Paid drops are permanently locked to your account. Only you can edit, rename, delete, or renew them. Nobody else can overwrite a key you own.</p>

<h2>storage quota</h2>
<p>Storage applies to files only — text clipboards don't count toward it. Your usage is shown on your account page and in the dashboard on the home page. Dropping a file that would exceed your quota is rejected at upload time.</p>
<p>When a file drop is deleted (by you or by expiry), its storage is freed immediately.</p>

<h2>free accounts</h2>
<p>Creating a free account requires only an email and password. No credit card. Free accounts get longer expiry, saved drops, export/import, and cross-device sync (your drops are attached to your account, not just your browser).</p>

<h2>upgrading & billing</h2>
<p>Paid plans are billed monthly through Lemon Squeezy. You can upgrade from your <a href="/auth/account/">account page</a>. Downgrading or cancelling returns you to the free plan at the end of the billing period — your drops aren't immediately deleted, but the paid limits no longer apply to new drops.</p>
<p>To manage or cancel your subscription, visit the <a href="/billing/portal/">billing portal</a>.</p>
