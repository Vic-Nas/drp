<h2>concepts</h2>

<h3>namespaces</h3>
<p>Text and files live in separate namespaces so their keys never collide:</p>
<table>
  <tr><th>URL</th><th>type</th></tr>
  <tr><td><code>/key/</code></td><td>clipboard (text)</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>/f/key/</code></td><td>file</td></tr>
</table>
<p><code>/notes/</code> is a clipboard. <code>/f/notes/</code> is a file. They're completely independent — same key name, different namespaces.</p>

<h3>reserved keys</h3>
<p>Some keys are reserved by the system and cannot be used for drops — for example <code>help</code>, <code>auth</code>, <code>admin</code>, <code>billing</code>. These correspond to top-level URL paths used by the application. The key availability check will show them as taken, and the server will reject them at save time.</p>

<h3>locking</h3>
<p><strong>Anonymous drops</strong> get a 24-hour creation lock. Nobody can overwrite or rename the key during that window. After 24h, anyone with the key can replace the content.</p>
<p><strong>Paid drops</strong> are permanently locked to your account. Only you can edit, rename, delete, or renew them. Nobody else can overwrite a key you own.</p>

<h3>saved drops</h3>
<p>You can bookmark any drop you didn't create — useful for drops shared with you. Saved drops appear in your account dashboard and are included in exports. Saving grants no edit or delete rights.</p>

<h3>anonymous drop claiming</h3>
<p>Drops you create before signing up are tracked by a browser cookie. When you register or log in, those drops are automatically claimed and transferred to your account, with their lifetime extended to free-tier limits.</p>
