# Integration tests — run manually, never by CI
# Usage: pytest integration_tests/ -v

# Don't collect integration tests when running the normal test suite
# (the normal suite lives in cli/tests/)
testpaths = integration_tests

# No automatic test discovery in the main cli/ package
norecursedirs = cli core .git __pycache__ .tox

# Show local variables on failure
showlocals = true

# Short tracebacks by default (override with --tb=long)
addopts = --tb=short
