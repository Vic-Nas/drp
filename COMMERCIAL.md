# Commercial License

The drp server is source-available under a custom license that permits
personal use and internal self-hosting, but prohibits operating a
publicly accessible hosted service for third parties.

## When you need a commercial license

You need a commercial license if you want to:

- Run a publicly accessible drp instance that accepts users outside
  your own organization
- Offer drp-based file sharing or clipboard functionality as part of
  a product or service to external users, whether free or paid
- Redistribute drp or a derivative work to others

## When you do NOT need a commercial license

- Personal use on your own machine or server
- Internal self-hosting within your organization, accessible only
  to members of that organization
- Using the CLI (`drp-cli`) with any host — the CLI is MIT-licensed
